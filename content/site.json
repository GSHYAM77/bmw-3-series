    "items": [
      { "question": "Is the BMW 3 Series reliable?", "answer": "Reliability depends heavily on maintenance. A well-maintained 3 Series can be solid, but upkeep costs are typically higher than non-luxury brands." },
      { "question": "RWD or xDrive?", "answer": "RWD is lighter and more ‘classic BMW’ in feel. xDrive adds traction and confidence in rain/snow—great if you drive year-round in bad weather." },
      { "question": "Is the M340i worth it?", "answer": "If you want a noticeably faster, sharper driving experience without stepping into a full M car, the M340i is often the sweet spot." },
      { "question": "What about the 330e plug-in hybrid?", "answer": "Great for short commutes where you can charge at home/work, while still having gas range for longer drives." },
      { "question": "What should I test on a test drive?", "answer": "Try city + highway, check braking feel, steering response, and comfort over rough pavement. Test infotainment and driver assistance too." },
      { "question": "Are maintenance costs high?", "answer": "Compared to mainstream cars, yes. Budget for premium tires/brakes and follow scheduled service intervals to avoid bigger repairs." },
      { "question": "What options matter most?", "answer": "Comfort seats, driver assistance, and the audio system are common ‘worth it’ upgrades—depends on how you drive." },
      { "question": "Does it hold value?", "answer": "Luxury sedans depreciate, but desirable trims (like M340i) may hold relatively better than base models." }
